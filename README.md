This is the first of a serie of three study projects.

My main goal is to build a fullstack blog for an international dance event. Their needs are mainly to post the artist who are going to be present on the days of event, as well news about the location, dates, schedules and tickets.

As i'm currently learning PHP with Laravel and already have some knowledge on Vue, i've thoguht about a "study" roadmap to achieve this goal. I'm going to build three projects.

1st - Only Laravel
2nd - Vue frontend + Laravel Backend
3th - Inertia

By completing them, I expect to have a good understanding on Laravel, learn more about Vue and also get in touch with Inertia, which i've never had.
